Metrics (concise meanings)

length, return                      : episode length and sum of rewards (higher is better)
success, steps_to_goal              : success flag and first step reaching x >= goal (lower is better)
x_max/x_min/x_range                 : coverage and momentum amplitude
right_half_frac / valley_frac       : residency near goal side / near left wall
goal_zone_frac                      : fraction of steps near the goal ridge
drift_x_index                       : signed position bias in [-1,1] (right +, left -)
rms_x, rms_v, v_p95, zero_cross_rate_v, stall_rate : stability/momentum proxies
left_rate/idle_rate/right_rate      : action distribution
action_flip_rate, smoothness_a      : control consistency (lower is smoother)
mean_push_rate, push_bias_index     : effort / left-right bias in actions
corr_action_vel                     : alignment of push direction with velocity
bounce_left                         : boundary contacts (lower is better)
