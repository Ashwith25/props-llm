# Environment:
{% include env_description %}

# Here's how we'll interact:

2. Your task is to look at the stats provided below and describe what might have happened in the iteration.
3. The description must be a 1 paragraph (3-4 sentences) of a detailed yet very concise description.

# Statistics Definitions:
{% include stats_definitions %}

# Trials Stats:
